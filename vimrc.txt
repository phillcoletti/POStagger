 " REQUIRED. This makes vim invoke Latex-Suite when you open a tex file.
 " filetype plugin on
 "
 " " IMPORTANT: win32 users will need to have 'shellslash' set so that latex
 " " can be called correctly.
 " set shellslash
 "
 " " IMPORTANT: grep will sometimes skip displaying the file name if you
 " " search in a singe file. This will confuse Latex-Suite. Set your grep
 " " program to always generate a file-name.
 " set grepprg=grep\ -nH\ $*
 "
 " " OPTIONAL: This enables automatic indentation as you type.
 " filetype indent on
 "
 " " OPTIONAL: Starting with Vim 7, the filetype of empty .tex files defaults
 " to
 " " 'plaintex' instead of 'tex', which results in vim-latex not being loaded.
 " " The following changes the default filetype back to 'tex':
 " let g:tex_flavor='latex'
